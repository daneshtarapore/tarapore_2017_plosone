The fault detection algorithm is part of the study: Tarapore, Danesh, Anders Lyhne Christensen, and Jon Timmis. "Generic, scalable and decentralized fault detection for robot swarms." PloS one 12.8 (2017): e0182058.

Refer to https://github.com/daneshtarapore/faultdetection-epuckswarm for an updated version of the fault detection algorithm tested on ARGoS version 3.0.0-beta49.
